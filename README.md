# Django Practice & Learning Repository

This repository contains my **Django practice projects, experiments, and learning files**.  
It’s a hands-on space where I explore Django concepts by building small apps, testing ideas, and making (and fixing) mistakes along the way.

Nothing here is meant to be “perfect” because the goal is **learning by doing**.
